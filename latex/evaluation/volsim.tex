\section{Simulator Evaluation}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Measure Latency (Don't forget to mention the latency of the camera as well (exposure time))
	\item Measure Accuracy (How often tracker loses track of hand)
	\item In for example do tasks and see how many times it loses tracking and why.
	\item Limitations of the simulator
	\item It works on other machines first run, (different machine different gpu). Verify it works on WSL?
	\begin {enumerate}
		\item Occlusion (show a picture of occlusion with fingers behind the palm of the hand)
		\item Lighting
		\item Hand size
	\end{enumerate}
