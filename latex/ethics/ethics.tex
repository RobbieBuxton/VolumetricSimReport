\section{User Study}
We ran a user study to evaluate our simulator titled "A Virtual Volumetric Screen User Study". We undertook Imperial College London's "Science Engineering Technology Research Ethics Committee process" which was reviewed by the "Research Governance and Integrity Team" and the head of the computing department. We gained approval on the 2nd May 2024 and ran our study between May and July \textcolor{red}{find first and last date of participants}. 

\subsection{Human participants}
As we ran our study on human participants we had to ensure we conducted our study in an ethical way. We consulted the Equality Act 2010 to make sure we did not exclude any participants \tocite. We were also careful to not use any participants that might feel perceived pressure to participate or might feel influenced by the researchers conducting the study. Participants were presented with an information sheet and a consent form before the study began.   

\subsection{Data collection}
While collecting data for our study we were careful to comply with the local regulations (\textbf{GDPR}) \tocite. All data was stored on a secure computer on campus and was only accessible by the researchers, or was stored on Imperials secure cloud network. We also made sure to anonymise the data when presenting it in our report. Data will be retained until 30th June 2034.

\subsection{Military applications}
This technology in theory could be used for military applications, however, we believe is unlikely to be used for such purposes, and if it was, it would not be directly used in combat and would be no more dangerous than other existing technologies.

\subsection{Copywrite Limitations}
\subsubsection{Open Source}
We will be using the Azure Kinect SDK which is licensed under the MIT license. We will also be using the Nix package manager which is licensed under the LGPL-2.1 license. Furthermore, we will also be using the Nixpkgs repository which is licensed under the MIT license. We will also be using the \texttt{dlib} library which is licensed under the Boost Software License 1.0 (BSL-1.0). We will also be using the OpenGL library which is licensed under the open-source license for the use of sample Implementation (SI). Furthermore, we will also be using the GLFW library which is licensed under the zlib license. We will also be using the GLM library which is licensed under the MIT license. We will also be using the OpenCV license under the Apache License.

\subsubsection{Proprietary}
Furthermore, we use Microsoft's proprietary depth engine designed to work with the Azure Kinect SDK which is not open source.
