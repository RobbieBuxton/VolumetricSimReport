\section{Comprehensive Results}
Presented below are the detailed graphs and results from our user study, organized on a task-by-task basis. The graphs are divided into five sections, each corresponding to a specific task. The first two graphs are similar to those found in Evaluation~\ref{sect:eval-userstudy}, but are applied exclusively to this task. The subsequent four graphs display the fully plotted 3D paths of users under each condition, with each segment represented in a distinct color.
