  abstract  = {Modern High Performance Computing systems are becoming larger and more heterogeneous. The proper management of software for the users of such systems poses a significant challenge. These users run very diverse applications that may be compiled with proprietary tools for specialized hardware. Moreover, the application life-cycle of these software may exceed the lifetime of the HPC systems themselves. These difficulties motivate the use of specialized package management systems. In this paper, we outline an approach to HPC package development, deployment, management, sharing, and reuse based on the Nix functional package manager. We report our experience with this approach inside the GRICAD HPC center[GRICAD 2017a] in Grenoble over a 12 month period and compare it to other existing approaches.},

An update of the underlying Linux system requires a reinstallation in many cases and can quietly break software installed on the system. In this paper, we present an approach that allows for an easy installation of quantum chemistry software packages, which is also independent of operating system updates. The use of the Nix package manager allows building software in a reproducible manner, which allows for a reconstruction of the software for later reproduction of scientific results. The build recipes that are provided can be readily used by anyone to avoid complex installation procedures.},

  abstract  = {Stereoscopic, or multi-view, display systems are considered            as better alternatives to conventional two-dimensional (2D)            displays, since such systems can provide important visual cues for            the human brain to process three-dimensional (3D) objects. An            auto-stereoscopic display is a device that can render 3D images for            viewers without the aid of special headgear or glasses. In this            paper, we present a new design of an auto-stereoscopic swept-volume            display (SVD) system based on light-emitting diode (LED) arrays.            This system is constituted of a display device and a graphics            control sub-system. The display device is a 2D rotating panel of            LEDs, relying on ``persistence of vision'' to generate 3D images. The            graphics control sub-system is composed of a combination of PC            software, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and supporting            circuitry. The primary task of the graphics control sub-system is to            process 3D data and control each LED. In addition, a new 3D image            generation and rendering method was developed to reduce the            bandwidth requirement and to facilitate 3D image display.            Demonstrated in the experiments, a prototype of this system is            capable of displaying 3D images and videos with full 360{\textdegree} view            angles.}

  abstract = {Abstract A proof-of-principle prototype of a volumetric 3D-displaying system is demonstrated by utilizing the photo-activated phosphorescence of two long-lived phosphorescent metal-porphyrins in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a photochemically deoxygenating solvent. The first phosphorescent sensitizer, Pt(TPBP), absorbs a light beam with a wavelength of 635 nm, and the sensitized singlet oxygen is scavenged by DMSO. The second phosphorescent emitter, Pt(OEP), absorbs a light beam with a wavelength of 532 nm and visibly phosphoresces only in the deoxygenated zone generated by the first sensitizer. The phosphorescent voxels, 3D images, and animations are well-defined by the intersections of the 635-nm and 532-nm light beams that are programmable by tuning of the excitation-power densities, the beam shapes, and the kinetics. As a pivotal selection rule for the phosphorescent molecular couple used in this 3D-displaying system, their absorptions and emissions must be orthogonal to each other, so that they can be excited and addressed independently.},

Almost all of these systems have omitted stereo cues, making them easy to build, but it is not clear how much this omission degrades the 3D experience. In this study, we evaluate performance and subjective effects of stereo on 3D perception and interaction tasks with a spherical FTVR display. To control for calibration error and tracking latency, we perform the evaluation on a simulated spherical display in VR. The results of our study provide a clear recommendation for the design and use of spherical FTVR displays: while omitting stereo may not be readily apparent for users, their performance will be significantly degraded (20\% - 91\% increase in median task time). Therefore, including stereo viewing in spherical displays is critical for use in FTVR.},

The possibility of a free-space display in which 3D graphics can be viewed from 360° without obstructions is an active area of research—holograms or lightfield displays can realize such a display, but they suffer from clipping and a limited field of view. Here, we use a phased array of ultrasonic emitters to realize a volumetric acoustophoretic display in which a millimetric particle is held in midair using acoustic radiation forces and moved rapidly along a 3D path. Synchronously, a light source illuminates the particle with the target color at each 3D position. We show that it is possible to render simple figures in real time (10 frames per second) as well as raster images at a lower frame rate. Additionally, we explore the dynamics of a fast-moving particle inside a phased-array levitator and identify potential sources of degradation in image quality. The dynamics are nonlinear and lead to distortion in the displayed images, and this distortion increases with drawing speed. The created acoustophoretic display shows promise as a future form of display technology.}",

abstract={Science-fiction movies portray volumetric systems that provide not only visual but also tactile and audible three-dimensional (3D) content. Displays based on swept-volume surfaces1,2, holography3, optophoretics4, plasmonics5 or lenticular lenslets6 can create 3D visual content without the need for glasses or additional instrumentation. However, they are slow, have limited persistence-of-vision capabilities and, most importantly, rely on operating principles that cannot produce tactile and auditive content as well. Here we present the multimodal acoustic trap display (MATD): a levitating volumetric display that can simultaneously deliver visual, auditory and tactile content, using acoustophoresis as the single operating principle. Our system traps a particle acoustically and illuminates it with red, green and blue light to control its colour as it quickly scans the display volume. Using time multiplexing with a secondary trap, amplitude modulation and phase minimization, the MATD delivers simultaneous auditive and tactile content. The system demonstrates particle speeds of up to 8.75 metres per second and 3.75 metres per second in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively, offering particle manipulation capabilities superior to those of other optical or acoustic approaches demonstrated until now. In addition, our technique offers opportunities for non-contact, high-speed manipulation of matter, with applications in computational fabrication7 and biomedicine8.},

abstract={In this study, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a volumetric display system based on quantum dots (QDs) embedded in a polymer substrate. Unlike conventional volumetric displays, our system does not require electrical wiring; thus, the heretofore unavoidable issue of occlusion is resolved because irradiation by external light supplies the energy to the light-emitting voxels formed by the QDs. By exploiting the intrinsic attributes of the QDs, the system offers ultrahigh definition and a wide range of colours for volumetric displays. In this paper, we discuss the design, implementation and characterization of the proposed volumetric display's first prototype. We developed an 8 {\texttimes} 8 {\texttimes} 8 display comprising two types of QDs. This display provides multicolour three-type two-dimensional patterns when viewed from different angles. The QD-based volumetric display provides a new way to represent images and could be applied in leisure and advertising industries, among others.},
