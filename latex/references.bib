  abstract  = {Existing package and system configuration management tools suffer from an imperative model, where system administration actions such as upgrading packages or changes to system configuration files are stateful: they destructively update the state of the system. This leads to many problems, such as the inability to roll back changes easily, to run multiple versions of a package side-by-side, to reproduce a configuration deterministically on another machine, or to reliably upgrade a system. In this paper we show that we can overcome these problems by moving to a purely functional system configuration model. This means that all static parts of a system (such as software packages, configuration files and system startup scripts) are built by pure functions and are immutable, stored in a way analogously to a heap in a purely function language. We have implemented this model in NixOS, a non-trivial Linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager to build the entire system configuration from a purely functional specification.},

  abstract  = {Modern High Performance Computing systems are becoming larger and more heterogeneous. The proper management of software for the users of such systems poses a significant challenge. These users run very diverse applications that may be compiled with proprietary tools for specialized hardware. Moreover, the application life-cycle of these software may exceed the lifetime of the HPC systems themselves. These difficulties motivate the use of specialized package management systems. In this paper, we outline an approach to HPC package development, deployment, management, sharing, and reuse based on the Nix functional package manager. We report our experience with this approach inside the GRICAD HPC center[GRICAD 2017a] in Grenoble over a 12 month period and compare it to other existing approaches.},

  abstract = {Abstract The installation of quantum chemistry software packages is commonly done manually and can be a time-consuming and complicated process. An update of the underlying Linux system requires a reinstallation in many cases and can quietly break software installed on the system. In this paper, we present an approach that allows for an easy installation of quantum chemistry software packages, which is also independent of operating system updates. The use of the Nix package manager allows building software in a reproducible manner, which allows for a reconstruction of the software for later reproduction of scientific results. The build recipes that are provided can be readily used by anyone to avoid complex installation procedures.},

  abstract  = {Stereoscopic, or multi-view, display systems are considered            as better alternatives to conventional two-dimensional (2D)            displays, since such systems can provide important visual cues for            the human brain to process three-dimensional (3D) objects. An            auto-stereoscopic display is a device that can render 3D images for            viewers without the aid of special headgear or glasses. In this            paper, we present a new design of an auto-stereoscopic swept-volume            display (SVD) system based on light-emitting diode (LED) arrays.            This system is constituted of a display device and a graphics            control sub-system. The display device is a 2D rotating panel of            LEDs, relying on ``persistence of vision'' to generate 3D images. The            graphics control sub-system is composed of a combination of PC            software, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and supporting            circuitry. The primary task of the graphics control sub-system is to            process 3D data and control each LED. In addition, a new 3D image            generation and rendering method was developed to reduce the            bandwidth requirement and to facilitate 3D image display.            Demonstrated in the experiments, a prototype of this system is            capable of displaying 3D images and videos with full 360{\textdegree} view            angles.}

  abstract = {Abstract A proof-of-principle prototype of a volumetric 3D-displaying system is demonstrated by utilizing the photo-activated phosphorescence of two long-lived phosphorescent metal-porphyrins in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a photochemically deoxygenating solvent. The first phosphorescent sensitizer, Pt(TPBP), absorbs a light beam with a wavelength of 635 nm, and the sensitized singlet oxygen is scavenged by DMSO. The second phosphorescent emitter, Pt(OEP), absorbs a light beam with a wavelength of 532 nm and visibly phosphoresces only in the deoxygenated zone generated by the first sensitizer. The phosphorescent voxels, 3D images, and animations are well-defined by the intersections of the 635-nm and 532-nm light beams that are programmable by tuning of the excitation-power densities, the beam shapes, and the kinetics. As a pivotal selection rule for the phosphorescent molecular couple used in this 3D-displaying system, their absorptions and emissions must be orthogonal to each other, so that they can be excited and addressed independently.},

As a visual medium, the LED cube has very specific properties and affordances, and optimizing the potential for such systems to create meaningful experiences presents many interlinked challenges. Two artworks exploring these possibilities are discussed. Both have been exhibited internationally in a variety of settings. Together with this paper, the works shed some light on the design considerations and experiential possibilities afforded by LED cubes and arrays. They also suggest that LED grids have potential as an emerging medium for immersive volumetric visualizations that occupy physical space.},

  abstract  = {Spherical fish tank virtual reality (FTVR) displays attempt to create a virtual "crystal ball" experience using head-tracked rendering. Almost all of these systems have omitted stereo cues, making them easy to build, but it is not clear how much this omission degrades the 3D experience. In this study, we evaluate performance and subjective effects of stereo on 3D perception and interaction tasks with a spherical FTVR display. To control for calibration error and tracking latency, we perform the evaluation on a simulated spherical display in VR. The results of our study provide a clear recommendation for the design and use of spherical FTVR displays: while omitting stereo may not be readily apparent for users, their performance will be significantly degraded (20\% - 91\% increase in median task time). Therefore, including stereo viewing in spherical displays is critical for use in FTVR.},
